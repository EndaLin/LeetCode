# Combine Two Tables
Table: Person
```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Table: Address
```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
```text
FirstName, LastName, City, State
```


#### Solution
```sql
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address on Person.personId like Address.PersonId
```
